ANGULAR FORMS
can put ng-model on any attribute directive

based on type of input element
put field on scope property

2-way binding
if something changes scope.creditcardnumber it changes the text

<input type = "text" ngmodel = "creditcardnumber">

select ng-model - "card.type"> means scope.card.type

don't need to add card.type to scope
creates an ng object

angular is very forgiving

<select ng-model="card.type">
	<option>Visa</option>
	<option>Mastercard</option>
</select>
<input type="text" ng-model = "card.number">

\\\\ good pattern

ngModelController (creates little controllers)
	- upshot: doesn't directly act or reaact with ocntroller
if we name the form, now there's a $scope.xxForm that exists

ng-options
